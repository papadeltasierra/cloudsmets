# ZGC - Telink Python Tool

> Google Translate actually does a good job of translating the Chinese comments!

## What It does?
Graphical control for the `ZBHCI` interface.

> Need to understand what the various tool type do and how they map to Zigbee constructs and the underlying APIs.

## Poetry It!
### Required Python Packages
|Package|Purpose|
|-|-|
|PyQt5|Graphical interface|
|pyserial|Serial port support|
|pandas|Powerful data structures for data analysis, time series, and statistics|

## Internals

### zgc_tool.py
- Top-level script
- Imports (and other standard packages)
  - `PyQT5`
  - `hcisendcommand` (from Telink tools)
    - csvFiles.py
      - settings.py
      - hcicommandparse
    - txtFiles.py
    - settings.py
    - ringbuffer.py
      - settings.py
    - mainwindows.py

### txtFiles.py
Seems to be writing some sort of text files, into time-stamped directories.

### settings.py
Looks like a Pythonic representation of the ZBHCI interface.

### ringbuffer.py
Implements a ring buffer for ZBHCI commands from somewhere.

### mainwindow.py
Autogenerated file that implements a PyQT5 application (?).

### icon.ico
An icon for the tool that shows "ZGC"

### hcisendcommand.py
- Uses the Python serial interface to send ZBHCI commands.
- Contains 3 classes:
  - Pyqt5Serial
  - AnalizeWorkThread (sic)
  - ProcessWorkThread

> Probably work translating the Chinese here to understand what it is doing.

### hcicommandparse.py
- Parses command files, not sure where from though.
